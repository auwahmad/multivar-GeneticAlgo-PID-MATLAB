PID Controller parameter optimization for DC Motor position control using Genetic Algorithm. 

As part of a research endeavor focused on parameter identification workflows using optimization techniques, I conducted a study utilizing Genetic Algorithms for tuning PID parameters in Controller Design. This approach involved integrating Genetic Algorithms into a Live Script task application, exploring multi-objective optimization for tuning proportional (Kp), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains.
The objective function, Integral Absolute Error (IAE), was employed to guide the optimization process. The study was specifically applied to the control of DC motor speed and position.
To enhance the complexity and applicability of the study, I integrated Simulink with MATLAB Live Script, enabling the creation and execution of sophisticated models such as first principle models using MATLAB code. This integration facilitated comprehensive experimentation and analysis within a unified platform.
